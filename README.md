# Handy Man - Your Local Skill Network

HandyMan is a digital platform bridging homeowners with skilled handymen for on-demand repair and maintenance services. The system features **dual-role accounts** (users can switch between requesting or offering services), **bidding-based task assignments**, and **in-app messaging**. Built with `Next.js` (frontend), `Spring Boot` (backend), and `PostgreSQL`, it prioritizes local service matching, transparent pricing, and mutual review systems.
